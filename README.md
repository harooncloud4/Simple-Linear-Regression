# Salary Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression model** to predict **Salary** based on **Years of Experience**. The model is built using Python and the `scikit-learn` library, and the results are visualized with `matplotlib`.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Train a **Simple Linear Regression** model on a dataset of salaries and years of experience.
- Predict salaries for unseen data (test set).
- Visualize the model's performance on both training and test datasets.

This is a beginner-friendly project to understand how regression works and how to implement machine learning workflows in Python.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **Salary_Data.csv**, which contains two columns:
- `Years of Experience`: The independent variable (input feature).
- `Salary`: The dependent variable (target).

The dataset is split into:
- **Training Set**: Used to train the regression model.
- **Test Set**: Used to evaluate the model's generalization performance.
